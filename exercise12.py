#The voltage (V) between the poles of a conductor is equal to the product of the current (I) in the ampere type passing through the conductor, multiplied by the resistance (R) on the conductor. It is represented by the formula V=I*R. 
# Using the formula, write a program that calculates the voltage between the poles of the conductor according to the current and resistance values ​​entered by the user.

current=int(input("Please enter current value: "))
ampere=int(input("pelase enter ampere value: "))
voltage=current*ampere
print("value of voltage is ",voltage)
